# AIPlayground - Frontend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jorgeguberte/aiplayground-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jorgeguberte/aiplayground-frontend)


This project serves as the frontend for a larger project, AIPlayground, which is my Artificial Intelligence code playground.

The current stack of this frontend project is:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) <sub>for testing</sub>


## Instructions
To build and run, clone the repo and <br/>run `npm install`. 

If the install went well, <br/>run `npm test` to check that everything works correctly and if it succeeds,

start with `npm start`.

If you want to pack it for production, just 
<br/>run `webpack` 

and it should be ready to go.

## Projected Features
Once the project reaches a stable and feature-rich build, i'll add a separation of production and development environments, so it will be ready to be deployed as well.
